      <p>At GURD-Rwanda, promoting Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights (SRHR) is central to our mission of empowering girls and young women especially those from vulnerable and rural communities. Through our integrated programs, we create safe, inclusive, and educational spaces where girls can learn about their bodies, challenge harmful norms, and make informed decisions about their health and futures.</p>

      <h3>Breaking Silence, Building Confidence</h3>

      <p>In many parts of Nyamasheke District, conversations around menstruation, puberty, and reproductive health are still surrounded by stigma, shame, and misinformation. These taboos often result in girls missing school, feeling isolated, or making unsafe health choices.</p>

      <img src="img/d2.jpg" alt="Girls gathered for SRHR session">

      <p>To address this, GURD runs SRHR sessions across all programs, where trained facilitators lead age-appropriate, culturally sensitive discussions on topics including:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Understanding bodily changes during adolescence</li>
        <li>Menstrual hygiene management</li>
        <li>Consent, healthy relationships, and bodily autonomy</li>
        <li>Breaking myths, taboos, and gender-based stigma</li>
        <li>Accessing reproductive health services without fear</li>
      </ul>

      <p>At Youth-Friendly Center in Nyamasheke district, girls find a safe and welcoming environment where they can speak openly, access accurate information, and receive practical support. One of the most impactful interventions has been the distribution of sanitary pads to adolescent girls and teen mothers. This simple yet powerful act ensures that girls can: Manage their periods with dignity and safety, remain in school during menstruation without fear or embarrassment and participate fully in learning and community activities.</p>
