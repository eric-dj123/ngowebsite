      At <strong>GURD</strong>, we believe that education should not be limited to the classroom.
      Vocational training equips youth and women in rural communities with practical skills that unlock economic opportunity and long-term independence.

      Our vocational training program is tailored to address the specific needs and realities of rural communities. Through practical, hands-on learning experiences, we empower youth and women to become job creators rather than job seekers. Participants receive not only technical skills but also mentorship and guidance to build confidence and resilience. We work closely with local partners, businesses, and artisans to ensure our graduates can transition smoothly into the workforce or launch their own enterprises. By aligning skills training with market demand, we foster sustainable livelihoods, support local economies, and help break the cycle of poverty.
